## Exercise - Selecting DOM elements

This is an exercise in finding elements on the page (in the DOM).

Your task is to choose items on the web page and write the javascript necessary to retrieve the objects which represent those elements.

Some suggestions:
1. Select the `<body>`
- Select the `<header>`
- Select all of the elements with class .quote
- Select all of the subject elements
- Select the navigation links
- Select all the quotes in the "life" section.
- Using relative selection, select the `<p>` element containing the second Mark Twain quote
- Do the same using a query selector
- Select the 'Quotes About Motivation' heading

### Bonus
 Using the console, add the author's last name, as a class, to one of the quotes.
